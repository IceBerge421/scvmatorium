Your form is of coils, an ouroboros of fate denied and souls usurped into a hellish scaled visage born in emulation of the Basilisks. You are hated by HE and held derelict, a wastrel in the eyes of SHE. But for all their venoms, you hear the writhing whispers that drive their apotheosis. When Yetsabu-Nech emerges from the underworld and the sun is snuffed of light, you will usurp your betters and sit upon a throne of void.",
